# Custom ROS 2 Services - Server-Client Systems

This README.md file contains three beginner-level ROS 2 systems, all using the **server-client (ros2servvices)** model. 
Each system utilizes custom ROS 2 services for communication between nodes. No sensor subscriptions are involved; the focus is on simplicity and mastering the fundamentals.

## Resources to aid you while solving the problem:
- [geometry_msgs](https://docs.ros2.org/galactic/api/geometry_msgs/index-msg.html)
- [sensor_msgs](https://docs.ros2.org/galactic/api/sensor_msgs/index-msg.html)
- [std_msgs](https://docs.ros2.org/galactic/api/std_msgs/index-msg.html)

## Problem 1:Agricultural Robot Harvest Scheduling Service
In a smart farming environment, an autonomous harvesting robot must report its current crop yield and operational status to a central farm management system. The system should evaluate the data to schedule harvesting tasks based on crop yield and robot availability.

### Objective: 
Implement a ROS 2 service where the harvesting robot sends its robot ID, crop yield (in kilograms) and operational status (harvesting/maintenance/idle), and the farm management system responds with a harvesting schedule (idle/maintenance/nextfield).

### Hint:
- Keep the data types of request and response simple (Feel free to explore the resources though)

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Problem 2: Emergency Response Robot Coordination Service
In an emergency response scenario, various autonomous robots (e.g., fire extinguishers, medical aid robots) must report their current status and operational state to a central command center. The command center evaluates these reports to assign new tasks based on the robotsâ€™ statuses and operational states, prioritizing high-urgency tasks.

### Objective:
Implement a ROS 2 service where emergency robots report their current status (some task/None) and operational state (active/standby/charging), and the command center responds with new task assignments (think of something creatively) and task's priority (anywhere between 1 to 5. **1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest**).

### Hint:
- Go with conditional statements while dealing with the priority
  
----------------------------------------------------------------

## Problem 3: Home Cleaning Robot Task Management Service
In a smart home environment, various cleaning robots perform tasks such as vacuuming and mopping. Each robot must report its current cleaning status and area covered. The home automation system should allocate new cleaning tasks based on the status and coverage area of each robot.

### Objective:
Implement a ROS 2 service where cleaning robots report their status (cleaning/charging/idle) and area covered (in m^2), and the home automation system responds with new cleaning status (clean/not_clean).

### Hint:
- Set the area of the house beforehand and include (or) pass it in your srv file.

## NOTE: All three problem statements and solutions are beginner-friendly and adhere to the server-client model without involving any sensor data subscriptions!
